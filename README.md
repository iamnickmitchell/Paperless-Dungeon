# THIS README IS PORTED OVER FROM THE PREVIOUS REPOSITORY.

### The app is currently being upgraded using react.js. All previous versions and releases are now broken and null. Please wait while a new release is created.

#### README.md is currently out of date. Please wait while it is being upgraded.


A website designed to teach me how to properly update, maintain, organize, and create apps. This will be functioning and regularly used (weekly at a minimum), meaning there are incentives to maintain and improve it. This is only going to be visible to those who request, are invited, and myself.

2) scroll down the page to see the character you wish to see.

To view character items-
1) click on the icon in the footer that looks like three people.
2) click on the icon of the respective player you wish to view
(If you don't know which icon you would like to see you can find it on the player stats page nest to the character name.)

---This feature is not yet implimented---

To view group funds, turn counter, turn timer, current day, or current weather-
1) go to the 3rd icon in the footer (a d6 "normal" dice)
*the page might take a minute to load if it hasn't been used recently because of the API having to wake up
2) !-Click on the "Next Day" buttons only if you are playing! If you accidentally click them or click them to see what happens please let me know at service@Ayrshiretechnology.com. I have to undo clicks that are done out of the game. Thank you for your understanding.
3) you can click on the next turn button as much as you'd like.
